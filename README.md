Researching and exploring ways to stop spyware and identify the culprits.
Hi all! I'm a 55 year old widowed mother, artist and old school programmer. This is all new to me, so no time like now to learn more! I'll take all the help and advice you have to offer. I'm being hacked/spied on by someone (probably recent ex psycho). They are recording my calls and all sounds. my screens and probably my keystrokes because they know my password everytime I change it (not saving or writing or telling ANTONE). hOPING TO HELP SAVE THE WORLD FROM VICIOUS PEOPLE LIKE THIS!
